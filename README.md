You can programmatically recover a damaged TIFF file with the help of Aspose.Imaging for .NET API as demonstrated below.

```csharp
// create an instance of LoadOptions and set LoadOptions properties
var loadOptions = new LoadOptions();
loadOptions.DataRecoveryMode = DataRecoveryMode.ConsistentRecover;
loadOptions.DataBackgroundColor = Color.Red;

// create an instance of Image and load a damaged image by passing the instance of LoadOptions
using (var image = Image.Load(dir + "template.tiff", loadOptions))
{
    // do processing
}
```
